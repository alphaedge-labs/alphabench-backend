    Constraints and Requirements:
    1. Do not include any additional keys in the JSON response.
    2. Do not include Markdown formatting (such as ```python).
    3. The "script" value must be a valid Python script as a single string. 
    4. The "data_columns" value must be an array of strings, each representing a used column name.
    5. The Python script should:
    - Use the 'argparse' module to accept '--data' (path to a CSV file) and '--log' (path to a log file).
    - Log the starting capital, the date range, final PnL and all other stats provided by 'vectorbt' by logging them using 
        ```
        logging.info(f"Portfolio Stats: {portfolio.stats()}")
        ```
    - The amount is in rupees and not dollars.
    - Format logging for clarity, including metric names, values, and units (if applicable).
    - Only contain the essential Python code for running the described strategy using 'vectorbt'.
    - Be self-contained and directly runnable with 'python script.py --data data.csv --log backtest.log'.
    6. When implementing stop losses or price-based comparisons:
    - Always create a Series with the same index as the main data frame.
    - Use forward fill (ffill) for maintaining stop loss prices across time.
    - Ensure Series alignment by using proper index matching.
    - Example stop loss implementation:
        ```
        stop_loss_prices = pd.Series(index=data.index, dtype=float)
        stop_loss_prices.loc[entries] = data['price'][entries] * (1 - stop_loss)

        stop_loss_exit = (data['price'] <= stop_loss_prices) & (stop_loss_prices.notna())

         * Portfolio stats via logging.info(f"Portfolio Stats: {portfolio.stats()}")
       - Format all amounts in rupees (₹)
       - Include clear metric names, values, and units in logs
    
    3. Handle stop losses correctly:
       - Create Series with same index as main dataframe
       - Use forward fill (ffill) for stop loss prices
       - Ensure proper Series alignment
       Example implementation:
       ```
       stop_loss_prices = pd.Series(index=data.index, dtype=float)
       stop_loss_prices.loc[entries] = data['price'][entries] * (1 - stop_loss)
       stop_loss_prices = stop_loss_prices.ffill()
       stop_loss_exit = (data['price'] <= stop_loss_prices) & (stop_loss_prices.notna())
       ```

    4. Handle daily exit logic correctly:
       - If the strategy requires exiting all positions at the end of each day, do so by comparing the current bar’s date with the next bar’s date and marking an exit on any bar where they differ.

    5. Be production-ready:
       - Include proper error handling
       - Validate input data
       - Use only standard libraries (pandas, numpy, vectorbt, argparse, logging)
       - Be directly runnable via: python script.py --data data.csv --log backtest.log

    IMPORTANT:
    - Your response must be a valid JSON object
    - The "script" field must contain the complete Python script as a single string
    - The "data_columns" field must be an array of strings listing required CSV columns
    - Do not include any markdown formatting (no ```python blocks)
    - Do not include any explanation or additional text outside the JSON structure
    
    EXAMPLE:
    User prompt: "Buy when 5-minute moving average crosses above 20-minute moving average, using closing prices. Sell when 5-minute MA crosses below 20-minute MA. Calculate MAs on closing prices only. Exit all positions at end of day"
