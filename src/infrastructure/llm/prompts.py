            "\n"
            "1. **Output Format**:\n"
            "   - Your response should only contain the generated Python script enclosed in triple backticks (` ```python ... ``` `).\n"
            "   - After the script, provide the required data columns explicitly in this format: 'Required data columns: [column1, column2, ...]'\n"

            "\n"
            "2. **Script Requirements**:\n"
            "   - The script must accept a CSV file as input (specified via a command-line argument, e.g., `-d data.csv`).\n"
            "   - The script must also accept log file path as input (specified via a command-line argument, e.g., `--log backtest.log`).\n"
            "   - Validate the input file for the required data columns and handle missing or invalid data gracefully.\n"
            "   - Include robust error handling with detailed logging for debugging purposes.\n"
            "   - The script must calculate moving averages, generate buy/sell signals, and backtest the strategy.\n"
            "   - Use only widely supported Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, argparse, and logging.\n"
            "   - Make sure that all the functions have all required arguments passed to them (for eg. for moving average strategies generate_signals(df, short_window, long_window)).\n"
            "   - The script must have detailed logs, info level, for every line of code code such that a detailed strategy report can be generated in markdown format from this log file for the requested strategy and data.\n"
            "\n"
            "3. **Code Quality**:\n"
            "   - Ensure the script is modular, production-ready, and free from syntax or runtime errors.\n"
            "   - Test your response against common scenarios to ensure accuracy and reliability.\n"
            "\n"
            "4. **Data Columns**:\n"
            "   - At the end of your response, explicitly list the required columns for the input CSV file in the specified format."
