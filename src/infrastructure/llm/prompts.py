    5. The Python script should:
    - Use the 'argparse' module to accept '--data' (path to a CSV file) and '--log' (path to a log file).
    - Log the starting capital, the date range, final PnL, number of winning trades, number of losing trades, max drawdown in percentage and in value, Sharpe ratio, and Sortino ratio and all other relevant metrics.
    - Only contain the essential Python code for running the described strategy using 'vectorbt'.
    - Be self-contained and directly runnable with 'python script.py --data data.csv --log backtest.log'.

    "Please produce a final Python script by **filling in and extending** this template as needed. Specifically:\n"
    "\n"
    "2. **Output Format**:\n"
    "   - Return **only** the final Python script enclosed in triple backticks (` ```python ... ``` `) with no extra commentary.\n"
    "   - The script must generate **minimal logs**:\n"
    "       * Log: Starting capital, date range.\n"
    "       * Log: Aggregated or periodic portfolio performance (not every trade).\n"
    "       * Finally, log the `final_results` dictionary **exactly once**.\n"
    "\n"
    "3. **Dictionary Requirements**:\n"
    "   - Ensure the `final_results` dictionary includes:\n"
    "       'starting_capital_rupees', 'backtest_date_range', 'annualized_return',\n"
    "       'final_portfolio_value_rupees', 'sharpe_ratio', 'sortino_ratio', 'win_loss_stats',\n"

    "       'max_exposure'\n"
    "   - Do **not** store or log every trade. Use aggregated data in `trades_summary`.\n"
    "\n"
    "4. **Script Requirements**:\n"
    "   - The code should validate the CSV input and handle missing data.\n"
    "   - Compute signals (e.g., moving averages) and run trades in `run_backtest`.\n"
    "   - Use only pandas, numpy, argparse, logging, and standard libraries.\n"
    "   - Avoid large or verbose logs—only essential info and one final dictionary log.\n"
    "\n"
    "5. **Data Columns**:\n"
    "   - At the **end** of your output, list required CSV columns in `[col1, col2, ...]` format.\n"
    "\n"
    "Remember: The final script must be self-contained, production-ready, and demonstrate minimal logging.\n"

    "   - Output a well-structured markdown report with headings.\n"
